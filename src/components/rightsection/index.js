            Iâ€™m a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect
            user interfaces that blend thoughtful design with robust
            engineering. My favorite work lies at the intersection of design and
            development, creating experiences that not only look great but are
            meticulously built for performance and usability.
